Introduction to Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn

Please bring a fully charged laptop

You dont need to have anything installed.
We will be using Azure notebooks *only*. 
Please set up an account at notebooks.azure.com. 

We will be using Python 3.

The lesson plan is as follows:

1) Quick introduction to Azure Notebooks (10 Minutes)
 - setting up a library
 - creating an Azure notebook
 - Markdown
 - installing libraries 
 - Other useful libraries (i.e. pandas and numpy)

2) Getting some data sets (5 Minutes)
 - Pre-Instaled Datasets
 - Uploading from local directory 
 - Uploading Datasets from github repositories.

3) Clustering Example (10-15 Minutes)
 - Quick example of clustering algorithm, using the iris data set
 - Now you try:

4) Regression Example (5-10 Minutes)
 - Quick example of regression algorithm, using the ..... data set
 - Now you try:

5) Binary Classification Algorithm (5-10 Minutes)
 - Quick example of Logistic Regression, using the SAhearts data set

7) How good was our model? (10 Minutes)
 - Confusion Matrices
 - True Positive, True Negative
 - Accuracy, Recall, Precision
 - Class imbalance

8) Random Forest (15 Minutes)
 - Quick example of Random Forest algorithm, using the Titanic data set
 - Now you try:
 - Variable Importance

9) Improving Your models (10 Minutes)
 - Variable Transformation
 - Feature Selection
 - Missing data
